# Citrix MAM SDK

The MAM SDK instruments your apps to enable enforcing policies and controls that are configured in Citrix Endpoint Management. It replaces areas of mobile device management not covered by the iOS and Android platforms. Rather than wrapping third-party apps using the MDX Service or MDX Toolkit, you instead create apps using the MAM SDK. 

See the [MAM SDK Overview](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) for more information.

## Usage

For usage information about the MAM SDK, see the [developer documentation](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/).

## Licensing and Agreements

Before you download and utilize the Citrix MAM SDK you must:

* Review the [Citrix License Agreement](https://developer.cloud.com/citrix-api-terms-of-use). By downloading and using the Citrix MAM SDK you agree to these licensing terms.  

## Sample Apps

Citrix has open-sourced some sample mobile apps that demonstrate how to use the MAM SDK in your projects.
