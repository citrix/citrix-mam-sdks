Similarly, HTTP authentication challenges are more likely to be serviced with single sign-on when using Secure Browse mode. If Off, the Preferred VPN mode will be the only mode that is used.\n\nDefault value is Off.\n
OUTBOUND_URLS_DESC_IOS_NOTE=\niOS apps can dispatch URL requests to other apps that have been registered to handle specific schemes (such as "http\://"). This facility provides a mechanism for an app to pass requests for help to another app. \n\nThis policy serves to filter the URLs that are passed from this app to other apps for handling (that is, outbound URLs). \n\nThe policy should be formatted as a comma-separated list of patterns in which each pattern may be preceded by a plus "+" or minus "-".  Outbound URLs are compared against the patterns in the order listed until a match is found. Once matched, the action taken is dictated by the prefix.  A minus "-" prefix blocks the URL from being passed out to another app.  A plus "+" prefix permits the URL to be passed out to another app for handling.  If neither "+" or "-" is provided with the pattern, "+" (allow) is assumed.  A pair of values separated by "\=" indicates a substitution where occurrences of the first string are replaced with the second.  You can use the regular-expression "^" prefix to search string to anchor it to the beginning of the URL. If an outbound URL does not match any pattern in the list, it will be blocked.\n\nDefault\:\n  +maps.apple.com\n  +itunes.apple.com\n  ^http\:\=ctxmobilebrowser\:\n  ^https\:\=ctxmobilebrowsers\:\n  ^mailto\:\=ctxmail\:\n  +^citrixreceiver\:\n  +^telprompt\:\n  +^tel\:\n  +^col-g2m-2\:\n  +^maps\:ios_addr\n  +^mapitem\:\n  +^sms\:\n  +^facetime\:\n  +^ctxinternalmail\:\n  +^ctxtasks\:\n  +^ctxsalesforce\:\n

OUTBOUND_URLS_DESC_IOS_CHAT=\niOS apps can dispatch URL requests to other applications that have been registered to handle specific schemes (such as "http\://"). This facility provides a mechanism for an app to pass requests for help to another application. \n\nThis policy serves to filter the URLs that are passed from this app to other apps for handling (that is, outbound URLs). \n\nThe policy should be formatted as a comma-separated list of patterns in which each pattern may be preceded by a plus "+" or minus "-".  Outbound URLs are compared against the patterns in the order listed until a match is found. Once matched, the action taken is dictated by the prefix.  A minus "-" prefix blocks the URL from being passed out to another app.  A plus "+" prefix permits the URL to be passed out to another app for handling.  If neither "+" or "-" is provided with the pattern, "+" (allow) is assumed.

West longitudes should be prefaced with a minus sign.\n\nDefault value is 0.\n
EXPORT_LEVEL_TIME_SUB_LOC=Meeting Time, Subject, Location
WORXWEB_URL_RESTRICTIONS_DESC=\nSecure Web normally does no filtering of web links it visits. This policy may be used to configure a specific list of allowed or blocked sites.\n\nThe policy is actually a list of allowed and blocked URL patterns which can be configured by an administrator to restrict which websites the browser may visit. The policy should be formatted as a comma separated list of patterns where each pattern may be preceded by a plus "+" or minus "-".  URLs evaluated by the browser are first compared against the patterns in the order list until a match is found. Once matched, the action taken is dictated by the prefix.  A minus "-" prefix instructs the browser to block the URL.  In this case, it will be treated as if the web server address could not be resolved.  A plus "+" prefix allows the URL to be processed normally.  If neither "+" nor "-" is provided with the pattern, "+" (allow) is assumed. If URL does not match any pattern in the list, it will be allowed. To block all other URLs, simply end the list with "-*".\n\nFor example, the policy value\n\n+http\://*.mycorp.com/*,-http\://*,+https\://*,+ftp\://*,-*\n\npermits http URLs within mycorp.com domain blocking them elsewhere, permits https and ftp URLS anywhere, and blocks all other URLs.\n\nDefault value is empty (all URLs allowed).\n

This is a comma-separated format such as sts.companyname.com, sts.company.co.uk. If the list is empty, then Secure Mail does not auto populate passwords. Secure Mail matches the listed hostnames with the hostname of the webpage encountered during Office 365 authentication and checks if the page uses HTTPS protocol.\nFor instance, when sts.company.com is a listed hostname and if user navigates to https\://sts.company.com, Secure Mail populates the password if the page has a password field.\nDefault value is login.microsoftonline.com.\n

VPN_MODE_SWITCH_DESC_DEFAULT_ON=\nWhen tunneling to the internal network, this policy permits switching between VPN modes automatically as needed. If On, a network request which fails due to an authentication request which cannot be handled in the preferred VPN mode will be retried in the alternate mode.  For example, server challenges for client certificates can be accommodated by Full tunnel mode but not when using Secure Browse.  Similarly, HTTP authentication challenges are more likely to be serviced with single sign-on when using Secure Browse mode.  If Off, the Preferred VPN mode will be the only mode that is used.\n\nDefault is On.\n
INTERNAL_NETWORK_DESC=\nIf On, the app is allowed to run only from inside the company network. If Off, the app can run from an external network.\n\nFor XenMobile 10, this policy is not supported. For XenMobile 9, if you require an internal network to run apps, you must configure the Beacons page of the XenMobile console (Configure > Settings > More > Beacons). Be sure to select the following check boxes\: Use internal, Check internal beacon first for Citrix Receiver and Secure Hub, and Use NetScaler Gateway.\n\nDefault value is Off.\n
OUTBOUND_URLS_DESC_IOS_WORXMAIL_IOS=\niOS apps can dispatch URL requests to other applications that have been registered to handle specific schemes (such as "http\://"). This facility provides a mechanism for an app to pass requests for help to another application. \n\nThis policy serves to filter the URLs that are passed from this app to other apps for handling (that is, outbound URLs). \n\nThe policy should be formatted as a comma-separated list of patterns in which each pattern may be preceded by a plus "+" or minus "-".  Outbound URLs are compared against the patterns in the order listed until a match is found. Once matched, the action taken is dictated by the prefix.  A minus "-" prefix blocks the URL from being passed out to another app.  A plus "+" prefix permits the URL to be passed out to another app for handling.  If neither "+" or "-" is provided with the pattern, "+" (allow) is assumed.  A pair of values separated by "\=" indicates a substitution where occurrences of the first string are replaced with the second.  You can use the regular-expression "^" prefix to search string to anchor it to the beginning of the URL. If an outbound URL does not match any pattern in the list, it will be blocked.\n\nDefault\:\n  +maps.apple.com\n  +itunes.apple.com\n  +apps.apple.com\n  ^http\:\=ctxmobilebrowser\:\n  ^https\:\=ctxmobilebrowsers\:\n  ^mailto\:\=ctxmail\:\n  +^citrixreceiver\:\n  +^telprompt\:\n  +^tel\:\n  +^lmi-g2m\:\n  +^maps\:ios_addr\n  +^mapitem\:\n  +^sms\:\n  +^facetime\:\n  +^ctxnotes\:\n  +^ctxnotesex\:\n  +^ctxtasks\:\n  +^facetime-audio\:\n  +^itms-apps\:\n  +^ctx-sf\:\n  +^sharefile\:\n  +^lync\:\n  +^slack\:\n  +^slackmdm\:\n  +^msauth\:\n  +^zoomus\:\n  +^msteams\:\n
