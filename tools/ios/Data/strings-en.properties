INBOUND_URLS_DESC=\niOS apps can dispatch URL requests to other apps that have been registered to handle specific schemes (such as "http\://"). This facility provides a mechanism for an app to pass requests for help to another app.\n\nThis policy serves to filter the schemes that are actually passed into this app for handling (that is, inbound URLs). Default value is empty, meaning that all registered app URL schemes are blocked.\n\nThe policy should be formatted as a comma-separated list of patterns in which each pattern may be preceded by a plus "+" or minus "-".  Inbound URLs are compared against the patterns in the order listed until a match is found. Once matched, the action taken is dictated by the prefix.  A minus "-" prefix blocks the URL from being passed into this app.  A plus "+" prefix permits the URL to be passed into the app for handling.  If neither "+" or "-" is provided with the pattern, "+" (allow) is assumed. If an inbound URL does not match any pattern in the list, the URL is blocked.\n
