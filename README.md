# Citrix MAM SDK

The MAM SDK instrument your apps to enable enforcing policies and controls that are configured in Citrix Endpoint Management. The MAM SDK replaces areas of mobile device management not covered by the iOS and Android platforms. Rather than wrapping third-party apps using the MDX Service or MDX Toolkit, you instead create apps using the MAM SDK. 

See the [MAM SDK Overview](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) for more information.

For more information about the MAM SDK APIs, see the [developer documentation](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/).
